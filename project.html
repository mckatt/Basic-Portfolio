      <p>Born in Detroit, Michigan a lifetime ago. I was involved in the music industry as a performer, composer, management and sound engineering. For the better part of the last 20 years, I have worked in IT as everything from systems administrator to operations as well as application and desktop support. I took a break in between IT positions to run an animation production company called Jazzpaws. I also have run an online community in the virtual world of Second Life for 10 years now called "Raglan Shire" which has over 3000 members and facilitates creativity and collaboration.</p>
